            Marine Wildlife Watch of the Philippines (MWWP) is a non-profit, non-stock conservation organization that aims to develop a better appreciation of the marine environment, its 
            ecological processes and how it affects all of us through activities that focus on long-lived marine animals, also referred to as Endangered, Threatened, and Protected Marine Wildlife (ETPs-MW), 
            such as dolphins, whales, dugong, sharks, rays, and marine turtles: iconic species of the marine environment. Marine Wildlife Watch of the Philippines was incorporated on the 13th of September 2010.

<div class="subtext2">

    The Marine Wildlife Watch of the Philippines has implemented a comprehensive array of strategies for marine conservation. 
    These initiatives involve robust surveillance and monitoring efforts, assessing coral reef health, tracking marine species, and
     combating illegal fishing practices and poaching. Prioritizing community engagement, the initiatives conduct educational programs to promote awareness of 
     marine biodiversity and advocate for sustainable fishing practices. Collaborative efforts with local communities include the establishment and management of 
     Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) to safeguard critical habitats. Scientific research is integral, providing insights into marine ecosystems, identifying threats, and 
     informing evidence-based conservation strategies. Furthermore, the initiatives engage in the rescue and rehabilitation of injured or stranded marine animals, 
    and collaborate closely with government agencies to enhance policies and regulations for the effective protection of marine wildlife.
